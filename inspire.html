  <h2>Who inspires me?</h2>
  <p>Frida Khalo is my inspiration and role model. Frida challenges society's standards about women. She demonstrates her story and her true self through her bold, vibrant paintings and portraits.</p>
  <p> My family is from Mexico and I am proud of where I come from and the beautiful culture we have.</p>
